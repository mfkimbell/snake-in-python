# snake-in-python

The goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of `pygame`. Some of the concepts I learned in this project were rendering, collision, game loops, user input, and screen coordiates. I followed the following guide by Eureka: https://www.edureka.co/blog/snake-game-with-pygame/

**Tools Used:**
* `pygame` to render all visuals
* `random` to allow for random generation of "food" for the snake
